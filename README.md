## Development

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

### Basic Workflow

One time config: `git config --global push.followTags true`

1. Develop
1. Write specs
1. Run `npm run test`
1. Run `git add .`
1. Run `npm run c` and choose fix or feature
1. Run `nx run <lib>:version --dryRun true`
1. Make sure that CHANGELOG looks right and run the command without --dryRun option
1. Run `npm run build:all`
1. Run `nx publish <lib> --ver=<required-version> --tag=latest`
1. Push changes `git push`

## Generate a publishable library

### Generate JS lib

```
nx g @nrwl/js:lib my-lib --publishable --importPath="@ngspot/my-lib"
```

### Generate NG lib

[Docs](https://nx.dev/packages/angular/generators/library)

```
nx g @nrwl/angular:library [optional-scope/]my-lib --publishable --importPath="@ngspot/my-lib" --changeDetection="OnPush" --prefix="ngs" --standalone --style="scss"
```

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@ngspot/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `nx build my-lib` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-lib` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `nx e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
